This project was a collaboration between my team of four. My role was coordinating and finding a project idea, API endpoints, database MySQL management, frontend PHP, and backend python programming. 
The project incorporates pulling JSON data from a NASA API, parsing the data into a database, and displaying it onto a website. 
Please note that the website no longer displays MySQL parsed data as the login credentials have been removed.
